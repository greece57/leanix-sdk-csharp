leanIX SDK for C#
=================

leanIX API version v1, https://developer.leanix.net

Overview
--------
This SDK contains wrapper code used to call the leanIX REST API from C#.

The SDK also contains a simple example. The code in [samples/client/SampleClient/SampleClient.cs](samples/client/SampleClient/SampleClient.cs) demonstrates the basic use of the SDK to read Applications from the leanIX Inventory.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to use the code in this SDK, the REST API needs to be activated in your workspace and you need your personal API Key. When you are logged in to leanIX, please go to your profile (click on the user icon in the top menu). You find a menu entry called "API / 3rd party apps". If the REST API is activated, you can generate an API Key here.

You can find the leanIX REST API documentation here https://developer.leanix.net. The documentation is interactive - if you are logged in to your workspace and the REST API is activated, you can try out every function directly from the documentation.

Including the SDK in your project
---------------------------------
The easiest way to incorporate the SDK into your C# project is to create a reference to the C#-Project LeanIX.Api.csproj. Please note, that the project required .NET Framework 4.5.

Usage
-----
In order to use the SDK in your C# application, import the following namespaces:
```c#
using LeanIX.Api;
using LeanIX.Api.Models;
using LeanIX.Api.Common;
```

You need to instantiate a leanIX API Client. Here you define the URL to the REST API of your workspace. Please replace `demo` with the name of your workspace. Also here you need to provide the Api-Key.
```c#
ApiClient client = ApiClient.GetInstance();
client.setBasePath("https://app.leanix.net/demo/api/v1");
client.setApiKey("31c7cfa0b5cb755f4c7f146c92d0ad6b");
```

You can then use the API class to execute functions. For each Fact Sheet in leanIX there is one API class, e.g. for the Fact Sheet "Application" the API class is called `ServicesApi`. To print the names of all applications which match the full-text search of "design", you could do the following:
```c#
ServicesApi api = new ServicesApi();
List<Service> services = api.getServices(false, "");

foreach (Service s in services)
{
	System.Console.WriteLine(s.ID + " " + s.name);
}
```
